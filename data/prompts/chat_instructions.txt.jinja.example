{#
Example: Custom chat instructions that extend the default template

This file demonstrates how to customize specific sections while keeping others default.
To use this approach:
1. Uncomment the {% extends %} line
2. Override only the blocks you want to customize
3. Rename this file to chat_instructions.txt.jinja

Note: When using {% extends %}, this file will inherit all blocks from the default
template and you only need to override the ones you want to change.
#}

{# Uncomment to use template inheritance:
{% extends "chat_instructions.txt.jinja" %}
#}

{# Example: Customize just the base instructions
{% block base_instructions %}
